We are creating an innovative Telegram Mini App (TMA) platform that features a variety of games where users can connect their wallets and deposit funds to play. Each game has a set entry fee, deducted at the time of play, with any winnings automatically credited to the user’s balance.

The games are designed to be simple yet engaging, featuring arcade-style 90’s classic games that bring the nostalgic feel of the 90s while offering users the chance to win rewards.

To enhance the user experience, the platform integrates with DEXs to stake user deposits, generating yield rewards that are directly added to their balance. This seamless combination of gaming and staking offers users both entertainment and financial benefits.

Additionally, we plan to utilize the Ankr SDK to simplify the staking process, enabling users to effortlessly earn rewards in a more accessible and efficient way.
